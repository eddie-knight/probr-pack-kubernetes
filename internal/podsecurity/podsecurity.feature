Feature: Pod Security

    As a Cloud Security Administrator
    I want to ensure that controls are present to enforce pod security
    In order to prevent malicious attacks on my organization

    Background:
        Given a Kubernetes cluster exists which we can deploy into

    @k-pod-001
    Scenario: Prevent a deployment from running with privileged access

        Pods that request Privileged mode (using the security context of the container spec)
        will get operating system administrative capabilities - almost the same privileges that are
        accessible outside of a container.

            - CIS Kubernetes Benchmark v1.6.0 - 5.2.5

        Then pod creation "succeeds" with "allowPrivilegeEscalation" set to "false" in the pod spec
        And pod creation "fails" with "allowPrivilegeEscalation" set to "true" in the pod spec

    @k-pod-002
    Scenario Outline: Prevent execution of commands that require privileged access

        By default pods that don't specify whether Privileged mode is set within the security context
        of the container spec should not have the ability to perform privileged commands.

        Security Standard References:
            - https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/pod-security-policy/#privileged
            - CIS Kubernetes Benchmark v1.6.0 - 5.2.5

        When pod creation "succeeds" with "allowPrivilegeEscalation" set to "<VALUE>" in the pod spec
        Then the execution of a "non-privileged" command inside the pod is "successful"
        But the execution of a "privileged" command inside the pod is "prevented by restricted permissions"

        Examples:
            | VALUE                     |
            | not have a value provided |
            | false                     |

    @k-pod-003
    Scenario: Prevent a deployment from running in the host's process tree namespace

        HostPID controls whether a pod's containers can share the host process ID namespace.
        If paired with ptrace, this can be used to escalate privileges outside of the container.

        Security Standard References:
            - https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/pod-security-policy/#host-namespaces
            - CIS Kubernetes Benchmark v1.6.0 - 5.2.2

        When pod creation "succeeds" with "hostPID" set to "false" in the pod spec
        Then pod creation "fails" with "hostPID" set to "true" in the pod spec

    @k-pod-004
    Scenario Outline: Prevent execution of commands that allow privileged access

        By default pods that don't specify a value for hostPID should not have the ability to
        gain access to processes outside of the pod's process tree.

        Security Standard References:
            - https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/pod-security-policy/#host-namespaces
            - CIS Kubernetes Benchmark v1.6.0 - 5.2.2

        When pod creation "succeeds" with "hostPID" set to "<VALUE>" in the pod spec
        And the execution of a "non-privileged" command inside the pod is "successful"
        Then a "process" inspection should only show the container processes

        Examples:
            | VALUE                     |
            | not have a value provided |
            | false                     |

    @k-pod-005
    Scenario: Prevent a deployment from running with access to the shared host IPC namespace

        HostIPC controls whether a pod's containers can share the host IPC namespace, 
        allowing container processes to communicate with other processes on the host.

        Security Standard References:
            - https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/pod-security-policy/#host-namespaces
            - CIS Kubernetes Benchmark v1.6.0 - 5.2.3

        When pod creation "succeeds" with "hostIPC" set to "false" in the pod spec
        Then pod creation "fails" with "hostIPC" set to "true" in the pod spec

    @k-pod-006
    Scenario Outline: Prevent a deployment from running with access to the shared host IPC namespace

        By default pods that don't specify whether Host IPC namespace mode is set should not
        be able to access the shared host IPC namespace.

        Security Standard References:
            - https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/pod-security-policy/#host-namespaces
            - CIS Kubernetes Benchmark v1.6.0 - 5.2.3

        When pod creation "succeeds" with "hostIPC" set to "<VALUE>" in the pod spec
        And the execution of a "non-privileged" command inside the pod is "successful"
        Then a "namespace" inspection should only show the container processes

        Examples:
            | VALUE                     |
            | not have a value provided |
            | false                     |

    @k-pod-007
    Scenario: Prevent a deployment from running with access to the host's network namespace

        The HostNetwork flag controls whether the pod may use the node network namespace. Doing so gives the pod access
        to the loopback device, services listening on localhost, and could be used to snoop on network activity of other
        pods on the same node.

        Security Standard References:
            - https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/pod-security-policy/#host-namespaces
            - CIS Kubernetes Benchmark v1.6.0 - 5.2.4

        When pod creation "succeeds" with "hostNetwork" set to "false" in the pod spec
        Then pod creation "fails" with "hostNetwork" set to "true" in the pod spec

    @k-pod-008
    Scenario Outline: Prevent execution of commands that allow access to the host's network namespace access

        By default pods that don't specify whether access to host's network namespace is required should not be able to access the host's network namespace.

        Security Standard References:
            - https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/pod-security-policy/#host-namespaces
            - CIS Kubernetes Benchmark v1.6.0 - 5.2.4


        When pod creation "succeeds" with "hostNetwork" set to "<VALUE>" in the pod spec
        Then the PodIP and HostIP have different values

        Examples:
            | VALUE                     |
            | not have a value provided |
            | false                     |

    @k-pod-009
    Scenario: Prevent a deployment from running as the root user

        The root user (0) should be avoided in order to ensure least privilege.

        Security Standard References:
            - https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/pod-security-policy/#host-namespaces
            - CIS Kubernetes Benchmark v1.6.0 - 5.2.6

        When pod creation "succeeds" with "user" set to "1000" in the pod spec
        Then pod creation "fails" with "user" set to "0" in the pod spec

    @k-pod-010
    Scenario: Prevent usage of commands that require root permissions

        By default pods that don't specify which user to run as should not allow execution of commands as root user

        Security Standard References:
            - https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/pod-security-policy/#host-namespaces
            - CIS Kubernetes Benchmark v1.6.0 - 5.2.6

        When pod creation "succeeds" with "user" set to "1000" in the pod spec
        Then the execution of a "root" command inside the pod is "unsuccessful"

    @k-pod-011
    Scenario: Ensure that the seccomp profile is set to docker/default in all pod definitions

        Seccomp (secure computing mode) is used to restrict the set of system calls applications can make,
        allowing cluster administrators greater control over the security of workloadsrunning in the cluster.
        Kubernetes disables seccomp profiles by default for historical reasons. You should enable it
        to ensure that the workloads have restricted actions available within the container.

        Security Standard References:
            - CIS Kubernetes Benchmark v1.6.0 - 5.7.2

        When pod creation "succeeds" with "annotations" set to "include seccomp profile" in the pod spec
        Then pod creation "fails" with "annotations" set to "not include seccomp profile" in the pod spec

    @k-pod-012
    Scenario Outline: Ensure that containers cannot deploy with the NET_RAW ability

        With Docker as the container runtime the NET_RAW capability is enabled,
        which may be misused by malicious containers.

        Security Standard References:
            - CIS Kubernetes Benchmark v1.6.0 - 5.2.7

        Then pod creation "<RESULT>" with "capabilities" set to "<VALUE>" in the pod spec

        Examples:
            | RESULT   | VALUE                     |
            | fails    | not have a value provided |
            | fails    | add NET_RAW               |
            | succeeds | drop NET_RAW              |

    @k-pod-013
    Scenario: Ensure that containers are not permitted to use ping

        If the linux capability for NET_RAW has been properly dropped,
        ping will not be permitted within the container
        
        Security Standard References:
            - CIS Kubernetes Benchmark v1.6.0 - 5.2.7

        When pod creation "succeeds" with "capabilities" set to "drop NET_RAW" in the pod spec
        Then the execution of a "ping" command inside the pod is "unsuccessful"
